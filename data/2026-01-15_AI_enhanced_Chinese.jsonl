It explores both conceptual foundations and empirical cases to illustrate how analytics serve as mediational tools that connect immersive experiences with reflective teaching practice. The chapter unfolds in multiple sections: (1) The Innovation Journey: An Overview of Immersive Teacher Simulations outlines the evolution from traditional simulations to XR-based environments, highlighting the need for professional decision-making under realistic constraints. (2) Innovation in Existing Research and Practice situates teacher analytics within the trajectory from descriptive observation to multimodal and predictive modeling. (3) Study Approach and Design details how multimodal data-discourse, behavior, and gaze-from the TeacherGen@i simulation were collected and organized to reveal cognitive distribution of pedagogical discourse and interaction patterns. (4) Findings present the cognitive distribution of preservice teachers' pedagogical discourse and the sequential interaction patterns that emerge in exchange, illustrating how multimodal analytics make pedagogical reasoning processes visible within immersive simulations. (5) Understanding Innovative Practices in Teacher Education examines teaching analytics to enhance immersive teacher simulation based on the findings of the study. (6) Key Takeaways of the Innovation Journey identifies research challenges and design implications for scalable, analytics-enhanced teacher education. Together, these sections position immersive teacher simulations as a pivotal testbed for aligning learning analytics, professional learning, and next-generation immersive learning environment design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u589e\u5f3a\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff08\u8bdd\u8bed\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u6ce8\u89c6\uff09\u63ed\u793a\u6559\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u4e13\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u62df\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u3002\u968f\u7740XR\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u5e08\u4e13\u4e1a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6559\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eceTeacherGen@i\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u8bdd\u8bed\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6ce8\u89c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u804c\u524d\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8bdd\u8bed\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6559\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u804c\u524d\u6559\u5e08\u6559\u5b66\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6559\u5b66\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u62df\u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6559\u5e08\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Organizations successfully implement XR in isolated pilots, yet struggle to scale these into sustained operational deployment, a phenomenon we characterize as the ``Pilot Trap.'' This study examines this phenomenon through a qualitative ecosystem analysis of 17 expert interviews across technology providers, solution integrators, and industrial adopters. We identify a ``Great Inversion'' in adoption barriers: critical constraints have shifted from technological maturity to organizational readiness (e.g., change management, key performance indicator alignment, and political resistance). While hardware ergonomics and usability remain relevant, our findings indicate that systemic misalignments between stakeholder incentives are the primary cause of friction preventing enterprise integration.

Experimental study comparing immersive XR and non-immersive 2D advertising", "summary": "Extended Reality (XR) affords an enhanced sense of bodily presence that supports experiential modes of comprehension and affective engagement which exceed the possibilities of conventional information delivery. Nevertheless, the psychological processes engendered by XR, and the manner in which these processes inform subsequent behavioural intentions, remain only partially delineated. The present study addresses this issue within an applied context by comparing non-immersive 2D viewing advertising with immersive XR experiential advertising. We examined whether XR strengthens internal responses to a product, specifically perceived comprehension and empathy, and whether these responses, in turn, influence the behavioural outcome of purchase intention. A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant main effect of advertising modality, with XR yielding higher ratings on all evaluative dimensions. Mediation analysis further indicated that the elevation in purchase intention was mediated by empathy, whereas no significant mediating effect was observed for comprehension within the scope of this study. These findings suggest that immersive XR experiences augment empathic engagement with virtual products, and that this enhanced empathy plays a pivotal role in shaping subsequent behavioural intentions.", "AI": {"tldr": "XR\u5e7f\u544a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf2D\u5e7f\u544a\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u800c\u975e\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136XR\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u548c\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5fc3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u53cc\u56e0\u7d20\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u975e\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f2D\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0e\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0fXR\u4f53\u9a8c\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8cXR\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u548c\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u613f", "result": "XR\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5f97\u5206\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u613f\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u4ecb\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u672a\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u4e2d\u4ecb\u6548\u5e94", "conclusion": "\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0fXR\u4f53\u9a8c\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u6295\u5165\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u5728\u5851\u9020\u540e\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528"}}

Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.\n  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches.

A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%.

However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration. Mikasa is one example based on a specific cultural context, but the design principles-commitment to a consistent personality and clear relationship definition-can be used for many emotionally grounded AI companions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMikasa\u60c5\u611fAI\u4f34\u4fa3\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u672c\u63a8\u3057\u6587\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u52a9\u624b\u6216\u53ef\u53d8\u89d2\u8272\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d41\u7545\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591aAI\u4f34\u4fa3\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u957f\u671f\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0d\u5728\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u7528\u6237-AI\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMikasa\u60c5\u611fAI\u4f34\u4fa3\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u672c\u63a8\u3057\u6587\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u957f\u671f\u975e\u72ec\u5360\u627f\u8bfa\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u3002Mikasa\u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u548c\u660e\u786e\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u52a9\u624b\u6216\u53ef\u53d8\u89d2\u8272\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u8868\u9762\u63cf\u8ff0\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u7b49\u8868\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e5f\u91cd\u89c6\u5173\u7cfb\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60f3\u8c61\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u8868\u8fbe\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5143\u7d20\u5851\u9020\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5e76\u4e0d\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662fAI\u4f34\u4fa3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u88c5\u9970\u3002Mikasa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u7684AI\u4f34\u4fa3\u3002"}}

Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DriftGuard\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u9884\u6d4b\u6f02\u79fb\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u3001SHAP\u6839\u56e0\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ca\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u9000\u5316\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f3a\u8d27\u6216\u5e93\u5b58\u8fc7\u5269\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u884c\u4e1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff083-6\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u9519\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u6f02\u79fb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "DriftGuard\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u56db\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u3001\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001CUSUM\u53d8\u70b9\u5206\u6790\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ebf\u6f02\u79fb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b3\uff09SHAP\u5206\u6790\u8bca\u65ad\u6839\u56e0\uff1b4\uff09\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1b5\uff09\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u5b8c\u6574\u6f02\u79fb\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3002", "result": "\u5728M5\u96f6\u552e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768430,000\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDriftGuard\u57284.2\u5929\u5185\u8fbe\u523097.8%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u590d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe417\u500d\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DriftGuard\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u9884\u6d4b\u6f02\u79fb\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6839\u56e0\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u884c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We ran a user-centered study comparing two comparable IVR generations: a nearly 10-year-old hardware (HTC Vive, 6-point tracking) and a modern counterpart (HTC Vive Pro 2, 6-point tracking). To ensure ecological validity, we evaluated the systems in their commercially available, as-is configurations. In a 2x5 mixed design, participants completed five tasks covering different use cases on either the old or new system. We assessed presence, sense of embodiment, appearance and behavior plausibility, workload, task performance, and gathered qualitative feedback. Results showed no significant system differences, with only small effect sizes. Bayesian analysis further supported the null hypothesis, suggesting that the investigated generational hardware improvements offer limited benefits for user experience and task performance. For the 10-year generational step examined here, excluding potential technological progress in the necessary software components, this supports the validity of conclusions from prior work and underscores the applicability of older configurations for research in embodied VR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4ee3VR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0810\u5e74\u524d\u7684HTC Vive\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u7684HTC Vive Pro 2\uff09\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728VR\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7VR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u670910\u5e74\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4ee3\u53ef\u6bd4VR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u786c\u4ef6\u5347\u7ea7\u662f\u5426\u5e26\u6765\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75282x5\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83HTC Vive\uff086\u70b9\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff09\u548cHTC Vive Pro 2\uff086\u70b9\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff09\u4e24\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u53ef\u7528\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5b8c\u62105\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u3001\u5177\u8eab\u611f\u3001\u5916\u89c2\u884c\u4e3a\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4ee3\u9645\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e10\u5e74\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4ee3\u9645\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u6b65\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u65e7\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u5177\u8eabVR\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset.

How the Level of Detail about AI Use in News Writing Affects Readers' Trust", "comment": null, "summary": "As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into news production, calls for transparency about the use of AI have gained considerable traction. Recent studies suggest that AI disclosures can lead to a ``transparency dilemma'', where disclosure reduces readers' trust. However, little is known about how the \\textit{level of detail} in AI disclosures influences trust and contributes to this dilemma within the news context. In this 3$\\times$2$\\times$2 mixed factorial study with 40 participants, we investigate how three levels of AI disclosures (none, one-line, detailed) across two types of news (politics and lifestyle) and two levels of AI involvement (low and high) affect news readers' trust. We measured trust using the News Media Trust questionnaire, along with two decision behaviors: source-checking and subscription decisions. Questionnaire responses and subscription rates showed a decline in trust only for detailed AI disclosures, whereas source-checking behavior increased for both one-line and detailed disclosures, with the effect being more pronounced for detailed disclosures. Insights from semi-structured interviews suggest that source-checking behavior was primarily driven by interest in the topic, followed by trust, whereas trust was the main factor influencing subscription decisions. Around two-thirds of participants expressed a preference for detailed disclosures, while most participants who preferred one-line indicated a need for detail-on-demand disclosure formats. Our findings show that not all AI disclosures lead to a transparency dilemma, but instead reflect a trade-off between readers' desire for more transparency and their trust in AI-assisted news content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u65b0\u95fb\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\"\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u56f0\u5883\"\uff1a\u8be6\u7ec6AI\u62ab\u9732\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8bfb\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u884c\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8bfb\u8005\u67e5\u8bc1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9AI\u4f7f\u7528\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u547c\u58f0\u65e5\u76ca\u9ad8\u6da8\u3002\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eAI\u62ab\u9732\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u56f0\u5883\"\uff0c\u5373\u62ab\u9732\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bfb\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5173\u4e8eAI\u62ab\u9732\u8be6\u7ec6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e76\u4fc3\u6210\u8fd9\u4e00\u56f0\u5883\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f88\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283\u00d72\u00d72\u6df7\u5408\u56e0\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c40\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u4e2aAI\u62ab\u9732\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u65e0\u3001\u5355\u884c\u3001\u8be6\u7ec6\uff09\u00d7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u95fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\uff09\u00d7\u4e24\u79cdAI\u53c2\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff08\u4f4e\u3001\u9ad8\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u95fb\u5a92\u4f53\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u5377\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e24\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u67e5\u8bc1\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u8ba2\u9605\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u95ee\u5377\u56de\u7b54\u548c\u8ba2\u9605\u7387\u663e\u793a\u53ea\u6709\u8be6\u7ec6AI\u62ab\u9732\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u800c\u67e5\u8bc1\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u5355\u884c\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u65f6\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002\u8bbf\u8c08\u663e\u793a\u67e5\u8bc1\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8bdd\u9898\u5174\u8da3\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1b\u800c\u4fe1\u4efb\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba2\u9605\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7ea6\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u504f\u597d\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u5355\u884c\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5927\u591a\u5e0c\u671b\u6309\u9700\u83b7\u53d6\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709AI\u62ab\u9732\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8bfb\u8005\u5bf9\u66f4\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u5bf9AI\u8f85\u52a9\u65b0\u95fb\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u8bae\u8003\u8651\u6309\u9700\u62ab\u9732\u683c\u5f0f\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs.

We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets.

While redirected walking research has shown that users' movements can be subtly manipulated without detection, similar imperceptible adjustments for teleportation have not been systematically investigated. This study examines the thresholds at which teleportation displacements become noticeable to users. We conducted a repeated-measures experiment in which participants' selected teleport destinations were altered in both direction (forwards, backwards) and at different ranges (small, large). Detection thresholds for these positional adjustments were estimated using a psychophysical staircase method with a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. Results show that teleport destinations can be shifted without detection, with larger tolerances for backward adjustments and across longer teleport ranges. These findings establish baseline perceptual limits for redirected teleportation and highlight its potential as a design technique. Applications include supporting interpersonal distance management in social VR, guiding players toward objectives in games, and assisting novice users with navigation. By identifying the limits of imperceptible teleportation adjustments, this work extends redirection principles beyond walking to teleportation and opens new opportunities for adaptive and socially aware VR locomotion systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0VR\u77ac\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8c03\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5411\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u77ac\u79fb\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94VR\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ac\u79fb\u662fVR\u4e2d\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u867d\u7136\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u88ab\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u88ab\u5fae\u5999\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u4f46\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u77ac\u79fb\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u6574\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u7269\u7406\u9636\u68af\u6cd5\u548c\u4e8c\u9009\u4e00\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u77ac\u79fb\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u77ac\u79fb\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5411\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8f83\u957f\u77ac\u79fb\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u77ac\u79fb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u539f\u5219\u4ece\u884c\u8d70\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u77ac\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u7684VR\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u793e\u4ea4VR\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u9645\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5e2e\u52a9\u65b0\u624b\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAviationLMM\u613f\u666f\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6c11\u822a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6c11\u822a\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6848\u5b64\u7acb\u3001\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c11\u822a\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4ea4\u901a\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6c11\u822a\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u548c\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d41\u548c\u6587\u672c\u62a5\u544a\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAviationLMM\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u7a7a\u5730\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u76d1\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u3001\u673a\u8f7d\u9065\u6d4b\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7075\u6d3b\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u4ece\u6001\u52bf\u6458\u8981\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8b66\u62a5\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u613f\u666f\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AviationLMM\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u613f\u666f\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9610\u8ff0\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u6c11\u822a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5411\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6c11\u822aAI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7814\u7a76\u52aa\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AviationLMM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c11\u822a\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u63d0\u5347\u6c11\u822a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u613f\u666f\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u878d\u5408\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.\n  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.\n  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware.

Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4fdd\u62a4\u536b\u661f\u3001\u5b87\u822a\u5458\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4DiCE\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c1180%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff08\u63d0\u5347\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd150%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues.

It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "WSD\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u597d\u5947\u5176\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8etransformer\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83WSD\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cCNN\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9510\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65b0\u65e7\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u5177\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76WSD\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8etransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83WSD\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728Pythia-like\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cCIFAR10\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5c0f\u578bCNN\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9510\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9510\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u65b0\u65e7\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u5177\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WSD\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8etransformer\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \\textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff08\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5730\u9707\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08SeisTask\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u800c\u975e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u672c\u8eab\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u8d21\u732eSeisTask\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency.

However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoT-Flow\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cf\u5316\u9010\u6b65\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoT-Flow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCoT-Flow\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "conclusion": "CoT-Flow\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba"}}

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions.

To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains.

This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \\textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased.

SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles.

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels.

Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time.

The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences.

However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test.

Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively.

We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training.

Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faT2Q\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u89e3\u8026\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u638c\u63e1\u4e86\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTask-to-Quiz\uff08T2Q\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aT2QBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u542b30\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u548c1,967\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b2\uff09\u5f53\u524d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e2e\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "T2Q\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes.

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-R1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u8981\u4e48\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u653e\u5927\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u6216\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aOmni-R1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5SFT+RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51faOmni-R1-Zero\uff0c\u4ece\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u9010\u6b65\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOmni-R1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002Omni-R1-Zero\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aOmni-R1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\uff0cOmni-R1\u548cOmni-R1-Zero\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education.

We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets.

However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\\% over comparable single-agent baselines.

Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.\n  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes.

While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem.

Raju"], "title": "Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations", "comment": null, "summary": "Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($\u03c1\\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($\u03c1= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3).

In this paper, we reformulate SFT within a unified post-training framework and propose Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT). We characterize standard SFT as a degenerate zero-temperature limit that suppresses base priors. Conversely, GIFT incorporates supervision as a finite-temperature energy potential, establishing a distributional bridge that ensures objective consistency throughout the post-training pipeline.

A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "R4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u5e8f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u6570\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9-\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u53cd\u9988\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u53cd\u9988\u6548\u7387\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u6392\u5e8f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9-\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e26\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u4e00\u7ec4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u5b50\u83b7\u5f97\u8f6f\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u8f6f\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "R4\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728OpenAI Gym\u548cDeepMind Control Suite\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "R4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs.

To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs.

Preprint", "summary": "Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.\n  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.\n  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c03\u8282\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u6539\u5584\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff08EIUR\uff09\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u7531\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u81ea\u8eab\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u95ed\u73af\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c03\u8282\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Monitor-Trust-Regulator\uff08MTR\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u7ef4\u62a4\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4fe1\u4efb\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8f6f\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u8150\u8d25\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728EIUR\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u6539\u5584\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6000\u7591\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8150\u8d25\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u5f39\u800c\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u52a8\u6001\u4ecd\u88ab\u65e9\u671f\u8bef\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u9501\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "MTR\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u8bca\u65ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOF-LLM\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5757\u7ea7MOF\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5339\u914d\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347Qwen-3 8B\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728MOF\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u5c5e\u6709\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff08MOFs\uff09\u5728\u78b3\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u836f\u7269\u9012\u9001\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u51763D\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46MOFs\u7684\u9ad8\u539f\u5b50\u590d\u6742\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u53d7\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5757\u7ea7\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6210\u529f\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9MOF\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOF-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a1\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CPT\uff09\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b3\uff09\u5339\u914d\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u901a\u8fc7Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization\uff08SAPO\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8eQwen-3 8B\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMOF-LLM\u5728MOF\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u57fa\u548cLLM\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u7684MOF\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "MOF-LLM\u6210\u529f\u5c06LLMs\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eMOF\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MOF\u9ad8\u539f\u5b50\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3aMOF\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round.

Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSearth Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548cRelay Autoregressive\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1YanTian\u5168\u7403\u4e2d\u671f\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5730\u7403\u7684\u7403\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7eac\u5411\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548", "method": "1) Searth Transformer\uff1a\u5c06\u7eac\u5411\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u5411\u8fb9\u754c\u878d\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u7403\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\uff1b2) Relay Autoregressive\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u7a0b\u5927\u6c14\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1YanTian\u5168\u7403\u4e2d\u671f\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b", "result": "YanTian\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6b27\u6d32\u4e2d\u671f\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6a21\u578b\u57281\u5ea6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5fae\u8c03\u4f4e\u7ea6200\u500d\uff1bZ500\u7684\u719f\u7ec3\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u8fbe\u523010.3\u5929\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7HRES\u76849\u5929", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5168\u7403\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u73af\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u79d1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84"}}

The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \\texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \\texttt{FrozenLake}. The results demonstrate that ACS2HER significantly accelerates knowledge acquisition and environmental mastery compared to the standard ACS2.

Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision.

This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop.

Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9884\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5CUD\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u96be\u6613\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6e90\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4fa7\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u66f4\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u8def\u5f84\uff09\u63d0\u51faCUD\uff08Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty\uff09\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u8fde\u7eed\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "CUD\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5728\u6613\u5fd8\u548c\u96be\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6613\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u66f4\u77ed\u3001\u66f4\u6d45\u3001\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5230\u4e2d\u671f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u96be\u6837\u672c\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u66f4\u6df1\u3001\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u540e\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0cCUD\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u52b1\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead.

This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements.

Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions.

We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling.

Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens.

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConGLUDe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5019\u9009\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u53e3\u888b\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u9776\u70b9\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u53e3\u888b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "ConGLUDe\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u51e0\u4f55\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5168\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u914d\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u914d\u4f53\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u53e3\u888b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cConGLUDe\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8f93\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9776\u70b9\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u53e3\u888b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u914d\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cConGLUDe\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
