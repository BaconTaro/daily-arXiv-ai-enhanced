Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era.

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily.

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashCache\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u5f02\u5e38KV\u5bf9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u968f\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u4eceKV\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u5e03\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u9891\u57df\u80fd\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u3002\u63d0\u51faFlashCache\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f02\u5e38KV\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u9891\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u7559\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5c42KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u591a\u5f02\u5e38KV\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlashCache\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe1.69\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\u548c80%\u7684KV\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashCache\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784(VSA)\u7684\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60(MIL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u4ee3\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801MIL\u7684iff\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683cMIL\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u8fdd\u53cdMIL\u7684iff\u7ea6\u675f(\u5305\u4e3a\u6b63\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e3a\u6b63)\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u865a\u9ad8\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faaMIL\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784(VSA)\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884ciff\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aVSA\u517c\u5bb9\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u5305\u542bVSA\u9a71\u52a8\u7684MaxNetwork\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6MIL\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548MIL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faaMIL\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u73b0\u6709MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VSA\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801MIL\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort.

Allowing users access to multiple navigation aids may help leverage the benefits of different navigational guidance methods, but may also have negative perceptual and cognitive impacts. In this study, users performed searches for virtual gems within a large-scale augmented environment while choosing to deploy two different navigation aids either independently or simultaneously: world-locked arrows and an on-screen radar. After completing the search, participants were asked to recall objects that may or may not have been present in the scene.

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset.

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52bf\u80fd\u6f14\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u786e\u4fdd\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHDR\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u534f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "HDR\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MirrorMind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u53cc\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3AI\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u79d1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u79d1\u5b66\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6765\u81ea\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u79d1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMirrorMind\u5206\u5c42\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u6784\u5efa\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u60c5\u666f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u4eba\u683c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\uff1b\u9886\u57df\u5c42\u9762\u5c06\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\uff1b\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5c42\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7f16\u6392\u5f15\u64ce\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u6267\u884c\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30MirrorMind\uff1a\u4f5c\u8005\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u4e92\u8865\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eMirrorMind\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u79d1\u5e7f\u5ea6\uff0cMirrorMind\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Existing methods often assume pre-defined missing modalities or fixed missing rates, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose Senti-iFusion, an integrity-centered hierarchical fusion framework capable of handling both inter- and intra-modality missingness simultaneously. It comprises three hierarchical components: Integrity Estimation, Integrity-weighted Completion, and Integrity-guided Fusion. First, the Integrity Estimation module predicts the completeness of each modality and mitigates the noise caused by incomplete data. Second, the Integrity-weighted Cross-modal Completion module employs a novel weighting mechanism to disentangle consistent semantic structures from modality-specific representations, enabling the precise recovery of sentiment-related features across language, acoustic, and visual modalities. To ensure consistency in reconstruction, a dual-depth validation with semantic- and feature-level losses ensures consistent reconstruction at both fine-grained (low-level) and semantic (high-level) scales. Finally, the Integrity-guided Adaptive Fusion mechanism dynamically selects the dominant modality for attention-based fusion, ensuring that the most reliable modality, based on completeness and quality, contributes more significantly to the final prediction.

The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data. This paper presents a first ablation study with systematic design choices for input tokenization, model configuration and temporal data preprocessing.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage.

To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice.

While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).\n  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.\n  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%.

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards.

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HTAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u9065\u611f\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982ReAct\u6216\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\uff09\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u9065\u611f\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5236\uff08HTAM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u5c42\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c42\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u524d\u4e00\u5c42\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eHTAM\u6784\u5efa\u7684EarthAgent\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728GeoPlan-bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u56fa\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u53ef\u9760\u4e13\u4e1a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5bf9LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u57df\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591aLLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u793a\u4f8b\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6216\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u7684LLM\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5230\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u56e0\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u4ece\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6fc0\u52b1\u4ea7\u751f\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u6210\u529f\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6bd4\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u79fb\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u57df\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSRA-CP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752820%\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027CP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534715%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528CP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f20\u8f93\u5927\u91cf\u4e0e\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8d85\u51fa\u53ef\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8f66\u8f86\u6301\u7eed\u5e7f\u64ad\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u5173\u76f2\u533a\u65f6\u542f\u52a8\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u901a\u7528CP\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752820%\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027CP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534715%\u3002", "conclusion": "SRA-CP\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CP\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments.

Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Tree of Claims (ToC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7f16\u8f91\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u8303\u56f4\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8303\u56f4\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u624b\u52a8\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u8d77\u8349\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7ec6\u5316\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "ToC\u6846\u67b6\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684EditorAgent\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u7840\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caExaminerAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u62ab\u9732\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u4e13\u5229\u5ba1\u67e5\u5458\u6279\u8bc4\u3002", "result": "\u57281145\u4e2a\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cToC\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6LLM\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u9ad88%\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u8fbe9%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ToC\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u8d28\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7a33\u5065\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4fee\u8ba2\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ToC\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u6027MCTS\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting.

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6f14\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u5185\u751f\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5982\u7a33\u6001\u673a\u5668\u8fd0\u884c\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u7684\u96f6\u8f93\u51fa\u671f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5197\u4f59\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5224\u522b\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEMTC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53d8\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u5185\u751f\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u3002IVM\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\uff0cMEV\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEMTC\u4f18\u4e8e8\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53474.85%\u3002", "conclusion": "EMTC\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations.

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5(GU)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u68af\u5ea6\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u548c\u5207\u5411\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u6267\u884c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u91cf\u6765\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u65b0\u5982\u4f55\u635f\u5bb3\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u68af\u5ea6\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u5411\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u6267\u884c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "GU\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728TOFU\u3001MUSE\u548cWMDP\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u8026\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5730\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a42\u5e74\u6cdb\u5317\u6781\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5c06AVHRR GAC\u6570\u636e\u4ece\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52301\u516c\u91cc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u591a\u5e74\u51bb\u571f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u6696\uff0c\u4f46AVHRR\u5168\u7403\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7c97\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u591a\u5e74\u51bb\u571f\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u957f\u671fLST\u8bb0\u5f55\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6c14\u5019\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5MODIS LST\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u548c\u690d\u88ab\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c06AVHRR GAC\u6570\u636e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52301\u516c\u91cc\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u6574\u4e2a\u6cdb\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a42\u5e74\u3001\u6bcf\u65e5\u4e24\u6b21\u76841\u516c\u91ccLST\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5e74\u51bb\u571f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8fd1\u5730\u8868\u6c14\u6e29\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u683c\u9675\u5170\u51b0\u76d6\u8868\u9762\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86MODIS\u524d\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u76d1\u6d4b\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5730\u8868\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u536b\u661f\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification.

Code to be released upon full publication", "summary": "Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time.

To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge.

SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model).

However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u65a5\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0eSGHMC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6392\u65a5\u529b\uff08MMD\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u6392\u65a5\u6548\u5e94\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ReBaPL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ReBaPL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u523b\u753b\u63d0\u793a\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies.

Coreset selection aims to accelerate training by identifying small, representative subsets of data that approximate the performance of the full dataset. Among various approaches, gradient based methods stand out due to their strong theoretical underpinnings and practical benefits, particularly under limited data budgets. However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.\n  In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations. First, we establish a connection between posterior sampling and loss landscapes, enabling robust coreset selection even in high data corruption scenarios. Second, we introduce a smoothed loss function based on posterior sampling onto the model weights, enhancing stability and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency.

These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions.

To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea'\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u4f3c'\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u987a\u5e8f\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u96f6\u9636\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LQR\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u63ed\u793a\u805a\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u4eab\u53d7\u534f\u4f5c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u53c8\u4e0d\u4f1a\u56e0\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u800c\u906d\u53d7\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002"}}
