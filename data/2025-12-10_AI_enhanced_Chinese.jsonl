This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1(DOD)\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1(OOD)\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7A*\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7248\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DOD\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6838CPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1(DOD)\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1(OOD)\u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86A*\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff1a\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD(ST-OOD)\u3001\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD(ST-DOD)\u3001\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD(MT-OOD)\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD(MT-DOD)\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548cCPU\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDOD\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u66f4\u5c11\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eA*\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u770b\u4f3c\u7ec6\u5fae\uff0c\u4f46DOD\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u52bf\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u662f\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \\textbf{SkipKV}, a \\textbf{\\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \\textit{eviction} and \\textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \\textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\\mathbf{26.7}\\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget.

Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "ThreadWeaver\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.53\u500d\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u76f8\u6bd4\u987a\u5e8fCoT\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742", "method": "1) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e26\u5e76\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684CoT\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8etrie\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3) \u5e76\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6548\u7387", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-8B\u7684ThreadWeaver\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5e73\u574771.9%\uff0cAIME24\u4e0a79.9%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.53\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747token\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f", "conclusion": "ThreadWeaver\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is the process of interpreting human intent through various input modalities, such as visual data (images and videos) and bio-signals. Bio-signals are widely used in HGR due to their ability to be captured non-invasively via sensors placed on the arm. Among these, surface electromyography (sEMG), which measures the electrical activity of muscles, is the most extensively studied modality. However, less-explored alternatives such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) can provide complementary information on subtle muscle movements, which makes them valuable for gesture recognition. In this study, we investigate the potential of using IMU signals from different muscle groups to capture user intent. Our results demonstrate that IMU signals contain sufficient information to serve as the sole input sensor for static gesture recognition. Moreover, we compare different muscle groups and check the quality of pattern recognition on individual muscle groups. We further found that tendon-induced micro-movement captured by IMUs is a major contributor to static gesture recognition. We believe that leveraging muscle micro-movement information can enhance the usability of prosthetic arms for amputees. This approach also offers new possibilities for hand gesture recognition in fields such as robotics, teleoperation, sign language interpretation, and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u5143\uff08IMU\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u9759\u6001\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0IMU\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u808c\u8171\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8868\u9762\u808c\u7535\u56fe\uff08sEMG\uff09\uff0c\u800cIMU\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f83\u5c11\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u7ec6\u5fae\u808c\u8089\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8865\u5145\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u808c\u8089\u7fa4\u7684IMU\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u808c\u8089\u7fa4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u808c\u8171\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u5728\u9759\u6001\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "IMU\u4fe1\u53f7\u5305\u542b\u8db3\u591f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff1b\u808c\u8171\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u662f\u9759\u6001\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u808c\u8089\u7fa4\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u808c\u8089\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5047\u80a2\u624b\u81c2\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

While AI-powered prediction applications offer a promising solution, they require a responsive and scalable back-end architecture to serve a large user base effectively. This paper details the development and evaluation of a scalable back-end system designed for a mobile diabetes prediction application. The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets.

RaX-Crash integrates three linked tables with tens of millions of records, builds a unified feature schema in partitioned storage, and trains compact tree based ensembles (Random Forest and XGBoost) on engineered tabular features, which are compared against locally deployed small language models (SLMs) prompted with textual summaries. On a temporally held out test set, XGBoost and Random Forest achieve accuracies of 0.7828 and 0.7794, clearly outperforming SLMs (0.594 and 0.496); class imbalance analysis shows that simple class weighting improves fatal recall with modest accuracy trade offs, and SHAP attribution highlights human vulnerability factors, timing, and location as dominant drivers of predicted severity.

However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery.", "AI": {"tldr": "KPI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u539f\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u60a3\u8005\u57fa\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u57fa\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u81ea\u8ff0\u75c7\u72b6\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u75be\u75c5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKPI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u75be\u75c5\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u539f\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u957f\u5c3e\u75be\u75c5\uff09\uff1b4\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKPI\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u53d9\u8ff0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "KPI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u5c3e\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \\emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $\u03c4$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \\emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\\ non-mutating steps and formalize \\emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\\%$ on Airline and upto $96\\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce \\cm{}, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects \\emph{Targeted Reflection} before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. \\cm{} delivers consistent gains, e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28\\% \\emph{relative} on Airline, +11\\% on Retail, and +7\\% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9\\%/+7\\%. We further identify ceiling effects in $\u03c4$-Bench, where annotation errors and underspecified tasks artificially cap model performance. To address this, we release $\u03c4$-Bench Verified, which restores benchmark headroom through targeted revisions. Our results argue for action-level analysis, targeted safeguards, and reliable evaluations as prerequisites for robust multi-turn agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u5931\u8d25\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u7a81\u53d8\u95e8\u63a7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u5757\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6e05\u7406\u7684CM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u03c4-Bench Verified\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6240\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u5426\u76f8\u540c\uff1f\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u5206\u6790\u03c4-Bench\uff08\u822a\u7a7a/\u96f6\u552e\uff09\u548cSWE-Bench Verified\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\uff08\u6539\u53d8\u73af\u5883\uff09\u548c\u975e\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b2. \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\"\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u504f\u79bb\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5373\u6700\u65e9\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u4e3a\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea7\u504f\u79bb\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51faCM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a81\u53d8\u95e8\u63a7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u5757\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6e05\u7406\uff1b5. \u53d1\u5e03\u03c4-Bench Verified\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u8ba2\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "1. \u6bcf\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u504f\u79bb\u4f7f\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff1a\u822a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u591a92%\uff0c\u96f6\u552e\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u591a96%\uff08SoTA\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff1b2. \u975e\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3. \u9519\u8bef\u968f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f1a\u504f\u79bb\u89d2\u8272\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u884c\u52a8\uff1b4.

However, the fluctuating availability of renewable energy affects the sustainability of public EV charging stations. Nearby public charging stations may utilize differing energy sources due to their microgrid connections - ranging from exclusively renewable to non-renewable or a combination of both - highlighting the substantial variability in energy supply types within short distances. This study investigates the near-future scenario of integrating dynamic renewable energy availability in charging station navigation to impact the choices of EV users towards renewable sources. We conducted a within-subjects design survey with 50 car users and semi-structured interviews with 10 EV users from rural, suburban, and urban areas. The results show that when choosing EV charging stations, drivers often prioritize either time savings or money savings based on the driving scenarios that influence drivers' consumer value. Notably, EV users tend to select renewable-powered stations when they align with their main priority, be it saving money or time.

It is well known that OoM interrupts the whole training itself and wastes substantial computational resources. Therefore, to prevent OoM, accurate prediction of GPU memory usage is essential. However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models.

Its development requires members' continuous participatory contribution and sensemaking. However, existing works mainly adopt a holistic sociological perspective to analyze well-developed collective memory, less focusing on member-level conceptualization of this possession or what the co-contribution practices can be. Therefore, this work alternatively adopts the latter perspective and probes such interpretative and interactional patterns with two mobile systems. With one being a locative narrative and exploration system condensed from existing literature's design frameworks, and the other being a conventional online forum representing current practices, they served as the anchors of observation for our two-week, mixed-methods field study (n=38) on a university campus. A core debate we have identified was to retrospectively contemplate or document the presence as a history for the future.

Human writers face time constraints, and extrinsic evaluations can be costly. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential in content creation, concerns about the quality of AI-generated content persist. Traditional evaluation methods, like human surveys, further add operational costs, highlighting the need for efficient, automated solutions. This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges. These agents can rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate AI-generated content, simulating human judgment by rating aspects such as coherence, interestingness, clarity, fairness, and relevance. By incorporating these agents, businesses can streamline content generation and ensure consistent, high-quality output while minimizing reliance on costly human evaluations.

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x.

However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy. Unfortunately, most existing sparse Transformer approaches are single-stage based, and their sparsity prediction mechanisms lead to significant power overhead when applied across multiple stages. To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications. Next, a mixed-precision multi-round shifting accumulation (MRSA) mechanism is further proposed to mitigate the accumulation overhead. A data-feature dependent filter (DDF) strategy is designed to work in concert with the MRSA process. Finally, an elaborate accelerator is designed to translate the theoretical enhancement into practical hardware improvement.

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236(rSIM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u5c06\u666e\u901aLLM\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(RLM)\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5316\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\"\u987f\u609f\"\u65f6\u523b\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591aLLM\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6ce8\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236(rSIM)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "result": "rSIM\u4f7fQwen2.5-0.5B\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3aRLM\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7Qwen2.5-14B\u3002\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u6b21\u5373\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "rSIM\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u666e\u901aLLM\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684RLM\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, the process of disease detection is often associated with extensive medical testing and considerable costs, making it impractical to perform all possible medical tests on a patient to diagnose or predict hundreds or thousands of diseases. In this work, we propose Collaborative Learning for Disease Detection (CLDD), a novel graph-based deep learning model that formulates disease detection as a collaborative learning task by exploiting associations among diseases and similarities among patients adaptively. CLDD integrates patient-disease interactions and demographic features from electronic health records to detect hundreds or thousands of diseases for every patient, with little to no reliance on the corresponding medical tests. Extensive experiments on a processed version of the MIMIC-IV dataset comprising 61,191 patients and 2,000 diseases demonstrate that CLDD consistently outperforms representative baselines across multiple metrics, achieving a 6.33\\% improvement in recall and 7.63\\% improvement in precision. Furthermore, case studies on individual patients illustrate that CLDD can successfully recover masked diseases within its top-ranked predictions, demonstrating both interpretability and reliability in disease prediction.

Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in T\u00fcrkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks.

A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of hierarchical structural semantics, which are crucial for generalization. In this paper, we propose SA^2GFM, a robust GFM framework that improves domain-adaptive representations through Structure-Aware Semantic Augmentation. First, we encode hierarchical structural priors by transforming entropy-based encoding trees into structure-aware textual prompts for feature augmentation. The enhanced inputs are processed by a self-supervised Information Bottleneck mechanism that distills robust, transferable representations via structure-guided compression. To address negative transfer in cross-domain adaptation, we introduce an expert adaptive routing mechanism, combining a mixture-of-experts architecture with a null expert design. For efficient downstream adaptation, we propose a fine-tuning module that optimizes hierarchical structures through joint intra- and inter-community structure learning.

Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset.

TSC tasks require models to effectively capture discriminative information for accurate class identification. Although deep learning architectures excel at capturing temporal dependencies, they often suffer from high computational cost, sensitivity to noise perturbations, and susceptibility to overfitting on small-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose FAIM, a lightweight Frequency-Aware Interactive Mamba model. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Filtering Block (AFB) that leverages Fourier Transform to extract frequency-domain features from time series data. The AFB incorporates learnable adaptive thresholds to dynamically suppress noise and employs element-wise coupling of global and local semantic adaptive filtering, enabling in-depth modeling of the synergy among different frequency components. Furthermore, we design an Interactive Mamba Block (IMB) to facilitate efficient multi-granularity information interaction, balancing the extraction of fine-grained discriminative features and comprehensive global contextual information, thereby endowing FAIM with powerful and expressive representations for TSC tasks. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised pre-training mechanism to enhance FAIM's understanding of complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness across various domains and high-noise scenarios.

However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

This paper introduces a framework using unsupervised machine learning to systematically detect suspicious trade patterns and highlight activities for review. Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare \"mega-trades\" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination.

Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches.

Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing.

However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms diffusion-based SOTA works on different tasks and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RFAMoE\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0cFusion MoE\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u5b8c\u6210\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u4f2a\u5f71\u5f71\u54cd\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1a1\uff09RFAMoE\u6a21\u5757\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u901a\u9053\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6240\u9700\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff1b2\uff09Fusion MoE\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210K\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u5b8c\u6210\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u591a\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MoE-based\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u566a\u58f0\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines.

Manually specifying ethical rules is labour-intensive and highly context-specific. We present Principles2Plan, an interactive research prototype demonstrating how a human and a Large Language Model (LLM) can collaborate to produce context-sensitive ethical rules and guide automated planning. A domain expert provides the planning domain, problem details, and relevant high-level principles such as beneficence and privacy.

In clustering applications, orthogonal NMF (ONMF) variants further impose (approximate) orthogonality on the representation matrix so that its rows behave like soft cluster indicators. Existing algorithms, however, are typically derived from optimization viewpoints and do not explicitly exploit the conic geometry induced by NMF: data points lie in a convex cone whose extreme rays encode fundamental directions or \"topics\". In this work we revisit NMF from this geometric perspective and propose Cone Collapse, an algorithm that starts from the full nonnegative orthant and iteratively shrinks it toward the minimal cone generated by the data. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the data, Cone Collapse terminates in finitely many steps and recovers the minimal generating cone of $\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ . Building on this basis, we then derive a cone-aware orthogonal NMF model (CC-NMF) by applying uni-orthogonal NMF to the recovered extreme rays. Across 16 benchmark gene-expression, text, and image datasets, CC-NMF consistently matches or outperforms strong NMF baselines-including multiplicative updates, ANLS, projective NMF, ONMF, and sparse NMF-in terms of clustering purity.

Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline. It is noteworthy that the agent-based architecture yielded the most substantial enhancements in reasoning logic and medical accuracy.

Autor Accepted Manuscript version", "summary": "Medical decision-making makes frequent use of algorithms that combine risk equations with rules, providing clear and standardized treatment pathways. Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models. Compared to decision trees, random forests, and other SR methods, Brush achieves comparable or superior predictive performance while producing simpler models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Brush\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e38\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u7ecf\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd9\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBrush\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e38\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "Brush\u5728SRBench\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cBrush\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Brush\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u89c4\u5219\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u6210\u4e3aAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\"\u5927\u8111\"\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8d4b\u4e88\u5176\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982GUI\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u9886\u57df\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u5047\u8bbe\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u4f1a\u81ea\u7136\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e76\u975e\u5982\u6b64\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc741\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8003\u8651\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u5165\u624b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u539f\u751f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

A key challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new information causes the model to lose its performance on previous tasks. Recently, explainable AI has been proposed as a promising way to better understand and reduce forgetting. In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning. CIP-Net avoids storing past examples and maintains a simple architecture, while still providing useful explanations and strong performance. We demonstrate that CIPNet achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to previous exemplar-free and self-explainable methods in both task- and class-incremental settings, while bearing significantly lower memory-related overhead.

Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes.

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e869\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740Agentic AI\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9762\u4e34\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7b26\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae(MCP)\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e869\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u5c31\u7eea\u7684Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARLoS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LoRA\u8868\u5f81\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790650\u591a\u4e2aLoRA\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u6563\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e9e\u5927\u4f46\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63cf\u8ff0\u6216\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790650\u591a\u4e2aLoRA\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u76f8\u5173LoRA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8fc7\u5f3a\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684LoRA\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "CARLoS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684LoRA\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u5206\u6790\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7248\u6743\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u610f\u613f\u6027\u7b49\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684LoRA\u5206\u6790\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data.\n  In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation. These findings suggest that offline MORL is a promising framework for enabling personalized, adjustable decision-making in critical care without the need for retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0PEDA DT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u9762\u4e34\u5e73\u8861\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u50f5\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002", "method": "\u5728MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08CPQL\u3001Adaptive CPQL\u3001PEDA DT\uff09\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08BC\u3001CQL\u3001DDQN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "PEDA DT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002"}}

While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning.

While linear attention mechanisms reduce this cost to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, they typically rely on fixed random feature maps, such as random Fourier features or hand-crafted functions. This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \\textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \\textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \\textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \\textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \\textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \\textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "LUNA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfsoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b58\u5728O(n\u00b2)\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u867d\u7136\u5c06\u6210\u672c\u964d\u81f3O(n)\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "LUNA\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5728\u4e8e\u5c06\u6838\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u672c\u8eab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0cLUNA\u5b66\u4e60\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8be5\u6620\u5c04\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u6b63\u5b9a\u6838\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u5728Long Range Arena\uff08LRA\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLUNA\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3cFLOPs\uff09\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728BERT\u548cViT-B/16\u5fae\u8c03\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u4e2d\u66ff\u6362softmax\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u77ed\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0cLUNA\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LUNA\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u4e0e\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "We introduce two new benchmarks REST and REST+(Render-Equivalence Stress Tests) to enable systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86REST\u548cREST+\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u521b\u5efa\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86REST\u548cREST+\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u7eaf\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8615\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\uff08OCR\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6587\u672c\u989c\u8272\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u5b57\u4f53\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9token\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3\uff09\u5373\u4f7fOCR\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6587\u672c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9token\u6570\u91cf\u4ecd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u6709\u673a\u5236\u6027\u5173\u8054\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning. Experiments on the different datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in unseen disaster scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5371\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u707e\u96be\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5371\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u57df\u5185\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5371\u673a\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u7f20\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2. \u672a\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7f20\u5e76\u5173\u6ce8\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u707e\u96be\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5371\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u707e\u96be\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ca\u65f6\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301"}}

Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \\emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an \"action chunk\") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \\textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}.

These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Youden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\uff09\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6b63\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9009\u62e9\u90a3\u4e9b\u626d\u66f2\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Youden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u662fJ\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "result": "Youden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528Youden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6216\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u6216F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u679c"}}

However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCSO\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9690\u853d\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6613\u533a\u5206\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5f31\u540e\u95e8\u7279\u5f81\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u7aef\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\uff1a1\uff09\u67d0\u4e9b\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u672c\u8eab\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u83b7\u5f97\u6781\u7aef\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u540e\u95e8\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5185\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u533a\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u8f83\u5f31\u65f6\u3002\u5173\u952e\u89c2\u5bdf\u662f\u540e\u95e8\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6765\u81ea\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u4ec5\u6765\u81ea\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7c7b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\uff08CSO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u7c7b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6291\u5236\u4f1a\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "result": "CSO\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6807\u7b7e\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6613\u533a\u5206\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5f31\u540e\u95e8\u7279\u5f81\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CSO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6291\u5236\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u853d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u6548\u7684\u590d\u6742\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff08BBG\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u524d\u6cbfAI\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u6050\u6016\u4e3b\u4e49\u6216\u83b7\u53d6\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5a01\u80c1\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff08BBG\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u8981\u7d20\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bd5\u70b9\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u9488\u5bf9\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\"\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u5f0f\"\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3aBBG\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u751f\u7269\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6280\u672f\u64cd\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5bf9\u624b\u80fd\u529b\u8c31\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "BBG\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u628a\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65b0\u9896\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6MiniHack\u6846\u67b6\u3001Maestro\u5bf9\u6297\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8db3\u7403\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u662f\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u4e9bAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u719f\u6089\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5148\u524d\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165MiniHack\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eNetHack\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6c99\u76d2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faMaestro\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u5f3aRL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u53cc\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3. \u5229\u7528\u8d28\u91cf-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8db3\u7403\u6e38\u620f\u9886\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RL\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6709\u6548\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684MiniHack\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u589e\u5f3aRL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684Maestro\u5bf9\u6297\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8db3\u7403\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdbRL\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u89c1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u84ec\u52c3\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u65b0\u9896\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \\emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \\emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \\emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass. Extensive experiments on both diffusion and flow-based models demonstrate that TreeGRPO achieves \\textbf{2.4$\\times$ faster training} while establishing a superior Pareto frontier in the efficiency-reward trade-off space.

As high-quality public data for large language models (LLMs) approaches exhaustion, on-device fine-tuning provides an opportunity to leverage private user data while preserving privacy. However, existing approaches are predominantly simulation-based or rely on IoT devices and PCs, leaving commodity mobile phones largely unexplored. A key gap is the absence of an open-source framework that enables practical LLM fine-tuning on mobile phones. We present MobileFineTuner, a unified open-source framework that enables end-to-end LLM fine-tuning directly on commodity mobile phones. MobileFineTuner is designed for efficiency, scalability, and usability, supporting full-parameters fine-tuning (Full-FT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). To address the memory and energy limitations inherent to mobile phones, we introduce system-level optimizations including parameter sharding, gradient accumulation, and energy-aware computation scheduling. We demonstrate the practicality of MobileFineTuner by fine-tuning GPT-2, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5 on real mobile phones. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations and establish MobileFineTuner as a viable foundation for future research on on-device LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "MobileFineTuner\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u666e\u901a\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u63a5\u8fd1\u67af\u7aed\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56IoT\u8bbe\u5907\u548cPC\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u624b\u673a\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMobileFineTuner\u7edf\u4e00\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u7247\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u5fae\u8c03\u4e86GPT-2\u3001Gemma 3\u548cQwen 2.5\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eMobileFineTuner\u662f\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "MobileFineTuner\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Some researchers have recently challenged such assumption and argued that decoupled weight decay should be set $\\propto \u03b3^2$ instead based on orthogonality arguments at steady state. To the contrary, we find that eliminating the contribution of the perpendicular component of the update to the weight norm leads to little change to the training dynamics. Instead, we derive that decoupled weight decay $\\propto \u03b3^2$ results in stable weight norm based on the simple assumption that updates become independent of the weights at steady state, regardless of the nature of the optimizer. Based on the same assumption, we derive and empirically verify that the Total Update Contribution (TUC) of a minibatch under the Scion optimizer is better characterized by the momentum-dependent effective learning rate whose optimal value transfers and we show that decoupled weight decay $\\propto \u03b3^2$ leads to stable weight and gradient norms and allows us to better control the training dynamics and improve the model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfAdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03b3\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u4e0b\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u88ab\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03b3\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u8fd9\u4e00\u957f\u671f\u672a\u53d7\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u63d0\u51fa\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d88\u9664\u66f4\u65b0\u5782\u76f4\u5206\u91cf\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u6539\u53d8\u4e0d\u5927\u3002\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u7a33\u6001\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u65e0\u5173\"\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86Scion\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u7684\u603b\u66f4\u65b0\u8d21\u732e(TUC)\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7531\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u221d\u03b3\u00b2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\uff1b2) \u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff1b3) \u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4) \u6700\u4f18\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u503c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u65b9(\u03b3\u00b2)\u800c\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u672c\u8eab(\u03b3)\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bbe\u7f6e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u4e0b\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aAdamW\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present a unified geometric-stochastic multimodal deep learning framework that integrates EEG, ECG, respiration, SpO2, EMG, and fMRI signals to model SUDEP and stroke vulnerability. The approach combines Riemannian manifold embeddings, Lie-group invariant feature representations, fractional stochastic dynamics, Hamiltonian energy-flow modeling, and cross-modal attention mechanisms.

Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis together indicate that supervised preconditioning can recover much of the accuracy of oblique forests while retaining the simplicity and robustness of axis-aligned trees.", "AI": {"tldr": "JARF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u6216\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u503e\u659c\u68ee\u6797\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u62df\u5408\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u68ee\u6797\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7c7b\u522b\u6982\u7387\u6216\u56de\u5f52\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u68af\u5ea6\u805a\u5408\u6210\u671f\u671b\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u5916\u79ef\uff08\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u671f\u671b\u68af\u5ea6\u5916\u79ef\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4f5c\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u7ed9\u6807\u51c6\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u68ee\u6797\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u503e\u659c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u503e\u659c\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u6811\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "JARF\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Venkatesh Babu", "Anirban Chakraborty"], "title": "Minimizing Layerwise Activation Norm Improves Generalization in Federated Learning", "comment": "Accepted to WACV 2024", "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning framework that enables multiple clients (coordinated by a server) to collaboratively train a global model by aggregating the locally trained models without sharing any client's training data. It has been observed in recent works that learning in a federated manner may lead the aggregated global model to converge to a 'sharp minimum' thereby adversely affecting the generalizability of this FL-trained model. Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum. We apply our proposed flatness-constrained optimization to the existing FL techniques and obtain significant improvements, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMAN\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u6bcf\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8303\u6570\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u5230\"\u5c16\u9510\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\"\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u6bcf\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8303\u6570(MAN)\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u80fd\u964d\u4f4eHessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MAN\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fed-SE\uff1a\u8054\u90a6\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u8fdb\u5316-\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7ea618%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387", "motivation": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u56e0\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFed-SE\u8054\u90a6\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c40\u90e8\u8fdb\u5316\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8fc7\u6ee4\u540e\u7684\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b2\uff09\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\uff1a\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u805a\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFed-SE\u76f8\u6bd4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea618%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Fed-SE\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u8fdb\u5316-\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation.

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points. Compared with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric models, DAO-GP consistently achieves superior or competitive performance, establishing it as a drift-resilient solution for online non-linear regression.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAO-GP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u7ebf\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e38\u5448\u73b0\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5728\u7ebf\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6f02\u79fb\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u7aa5\u63a2\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAO-GP\uff08\u6f02\u79fb\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u7ebf\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u65e0\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u7f6e\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86DAO-GP\u5728\u5e73\u7a33\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u6f02\u79fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u7a81\u7136\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8870\u51cf\u7ba1\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u6f14\u5316\u8bf1\u5bfc\u70b9\u3002\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDAO-GP\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u6216\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DAO-GP\u88ab\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6f02\u79fb\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately. This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TD\u8bef\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u5300\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u853d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u5747\u5300\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u52a0\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTD\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u6536\u655b\u5f71\u54cd\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5728L2\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6270\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0eTD\u8bef\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9003\u907f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u9632\u5fa1\u68c0\u6d4b", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u5230\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9690\u853d\u7684\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb"}}

However, many existing prediction models struggle with concept drift, limited temporal context, and instability across seasons. To advance forecasting in this domain, we introduce a newly constructed longitudinal NBA dataset covering the 2004-05 to 2024-25 seasons and present a deep learning framework designed to model long-term performance trends. Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC.

To mitigate these biases, existing approaches frequently depend on curated prompt datasets - either manually constructed or generated with large language models (LLMs) - as part of their training and/or evaluation procedures. Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart.

While high-throughput multiomics data is becoming increasingly abundant, converting this data into actionable predictive models remains a bottleneck. High-capacity, datadriven simulation systems are critical in this landscape; unlike classical mechanistic models restricted by prior knowledge, these architectures can infer latent interactions directly from observational data, allowing for the simulation of temporal trajectories and the anticipation of downstream intervention effects in personalized medicine and synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets.

In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts.

Submitted to the 34th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning", "summary": "Uplift modeling estimates the causal effect of an intervention as the difference between potential outcomes under treatment and control, whereas counterfactual identification aims to recover the joint distribution of these potential outcomes (e.g., \"Would this customer still have churned had we given them a marketing offer?\"). This joint counterfactual distribution provides richer information than the uplift but is harder to estimate. However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes. Our approach requires no causal assumptions beyond those of uplift modeling.

This work introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a novel framework for generating targeted adversarial perturbations that are both effective in manipulating forecasts and stealthy to avoid detection. WAAPO achieves this by incorporating constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness, ensuring that perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions.

We then present a modified form of TD($\u03bb$), called STD($\u03bb$), in which function approximators are trained with respect to relative state values on binary decision problems. A theoretical analysis, including a proof of monotonic policy improvement for STD($\u03bb$) in the context of the two-state system, is presented, along with a comparison with Bertsekas' differential training method [1].

L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model.

Khasawneh"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Density Estimates with Topological Optimization", "comment": null, "summary": "Kernel density estimation is a key component of a wide variety of algorithms in machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic dynamics and signal processing. However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach using a topology-based loss function for the automated and unsupervised selection of the optimal bandwidth and benchmark it against classical techniques -- demonstrating its potential across different dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1", "motivation": "\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u2014\u2014\u6838\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u800c\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5e26\u5bbd\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u91cf\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u8fde\u901a\u5206\u91cf\u3001\u73af\u3001\u7a7a\u6d1e\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9009\u62e9", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5e26\u5bbd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

The Open Polymer Challenge (OPC) addresses this gap by releasing the first community-developed benchmark for polymer informatics, featuring a dataset with 10K polymers and 5 properties: thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, density, fractional free volume, and glass transition temperature. The challenge centers on multi-task polymer property prediction, a core step in virtual screening pipelines for materials discovery. Participants developed models under realistic constraints that include small data, label imbalance, and heterogeneous simulation sources, using techniques such as feature-based augmentation, transfer learning, self-supervised pretraining, and targeted ensemble strategies. The competition also revealed important lessons about data preparation, distribution shifts, and cross-group simulation consistency, informing best practices for future large-scale polymer datasets. The resulting models, analysis, and released data create a new foundation for molecular AI in polymer science and are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable and energy-efficient materials. Along with the competition, we release the test dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexliu99/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025-test-data.
