This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\\\ \\href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u8425\u517b\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u529f\u80fd\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8425\u517b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8981\u6c42\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u589e\u5f3a\u4e24\u4e2aLLM\u529f\u80fd\uff1a(1)\u6d88\u606f\u6539\u5199\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c(2)\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8425\u517b\u54a8\u8be2\uff0c\u5728\u4e03\u5468\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709/\u65e0LLM\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u529f\u80fd\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u5bf9\u996e\u98df\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Yet it remains unclear how reliably they advise students, and how often otherwise helpful answers drift into unsupported claims (``hallucinations'').\n  This work provides a clear, domain-grounded overview of how current LLMs behave in this setting. Using realistic questions set drawn from ApplyBoard's advising workflows -- an EdTech platform that supports students from discovery to enrolment -- we evaluate two essentials side by side: accuracy (is the information correct and complete?) and hallucination (does the model add content not supported by the question or domain evidence). These questions are categorized by domain scope which can be a single-domain or multi-domain -- when it must integrate evidence across areas such as admissions, visas, and scholarships.\n  To reflect real advising quality, we grade answers with a simple rubric which is correct, partial, or wrong. The rubric is domain-coverage-aware: an answer can be partial if it addresses only a subset of the required domains, and it can be over-scoped if it introduces extra, unnecessary domains; both patterns are captured in our scoring as under-coverage or reduced relevance/hallucination.\n  We also report measures of faithfulness and answer relevance, alongside an aggregate hallucination score, to capture relevance and usefulness. All models are tested with the same questions for a fair, head-to-head comparison.\n  Our goals are to: (1) give a clear picture of which models are most dependable for study-abroad advising, (2) surface common failure modes -- where answers are incomplete, off-topic, or unsupported, and (3) offer a practical, reusable protocol for auditing LLMs before deployment in education and advising contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7559\u5b66\u54a8\u8be2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u7559\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7559\u5b66\u54a8\u8be2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7559\u5b66\u54a8\u8be2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ApplyBoard\u7559\u5b66\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u54a8\u8be2\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u4e3a\u5355\u9886\u57df\u548c\u591a\u9886\u57df\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u9519\u8bef\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u9886\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7559\u5b66\u54a8\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56de\u7b54\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u504f\u79bb\u4e3b\u9898\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u54a8\u8be2\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u9020\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eLLM\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u7406\u7531\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u4f18\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5355\u7ee7\u627f\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u5e2e\u52a9\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u671f\u671b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u572816\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aLLM\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u7406\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u91cd\u7ec4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u66f2\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5c42\u6b21\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\\% and 19.3\\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

This paper investigates a semi automated workflow that combines Google Gemini for script generation, Amazon Polly for voice synthesis, and Microsoft PowerPoint for video assembly. Unlike fully automated text to video platforms, this hybrid approach preserves pedagogical intent while ensuring script to slide synchronization, narrative coherence, and customization. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Gemini in generating accurate and context-sensitive scripts for visually rich academic presentations, while Polly provides natural-sounding narration with controllable pacing. A two course pilot study was conducted to evaluate AI generated instructional videos (AIIV) against human instructional videos (HIV). Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that AIIVs are comparable to HIVs in terms of learning outcomes, with students reporting high levels of clarity, coherence, and usability. However, limitations remain, particularly regarding audio quality and the absence of human-like avatars. The findings suggest that AI assisted video production can reduce instructor workload, improve scalability, and deliver effective learning resources, while future improvements in synthetic voices and avatars may further enhance learner engagement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Google Gemini\u751f\u6210\u811a\u672c\u3001Amazon Polly\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u548cMicrosoft PowerPoint\u89c6\u9891\u7ec4\u88c5\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u8bb2\u5ea7\u5236\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u95e8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u89c6\u9891\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8bb2\u5ea7\u5236\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u6765\u53d8\u9769\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6559\u5b66\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u811a\u672c\u4e0e\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff1aGoogle Gemini\u751f\u6210\u811a\u672c\uff0cAmazon Polly\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\uff0cMicrosoft PowerPoint\u7ec4\u88c5\u89c6\u9891\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u95e8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83AI\u751f\u6210\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u89c6\u9891\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u4f46\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7c7b\u4eba\u5316\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u4ecd\u662f\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u89c6\u9891\u5236\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6559\u5e08\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward.

To address this gap, our research builds upon these existing frameworks to develop a more comprehensive representation of people's lived experiences with privacy harms. We analyzed 369 privacy incidents reported by individuals from the general public. We found a broader range of privacy incidents and harms than accounted for in existing legal frameworks. The majority of reported privacy harms were not based on tangible harm, but on fear and loss of psychological safety.

For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification.

By integrating conductive yarns in looped or cut pile forms, PileUp transforms soft 3-dimensional textiles into multimodal sensors capable of detecting mechanical deformations such as pressure, bending, and strain, as well as environmental conditions like moisture. We propose a design space that outlines the relationships between texture, form factor, and sensing affordances of tufted textiles. We characterize electrical responses under compression, bending, and strain, reporting sensor behaviors. To demonstrate versatility, we present three application scenarios in which PileUp sensors are seamlessly integrated into soft fabrics: a meditation rug with multi-zone sensing, a fleece sleeve that detects arm motion, and a moisture-sensing wall art.

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dPPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86token\u7ea7PPO\u5728LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "PPO\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662ftoken\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) \u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5f97\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\uff1aTurn-PPO\u3001S-PPO\u548cST-PPO\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-PPO\u548cS-PPO\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u9632\u6b62\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6token\u7ea7PPO\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u8f6eLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08Multimodal-CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728A-OKVQA\u3001OKVQA\u548cChartQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46CoT\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u5c24\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1CoT\u5df2\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001CoT\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Zhang\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eT5\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u96c6\u6210\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46CoT\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u5c24\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Inspired by the success of FMs, particularly large language models, researchers have recently begun to explore spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) to improve adaptability and generalization across a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal (ST) tasks.

Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

However, a significant challenge arises in delivering haptic feedback to users' hands, due to the necessity for the hands to remain bare. In response to this challenge, recent research has proposed an indirect solution of providing haptic feedback to the forearm. In this work, we present QuadStretcher, a skin stretch display featuring four independently controlled stretching units surrounding the forearm. While achieving rich haptic expression, our device also eliminates the need for a grounding base on the forearm by using a pair of counteracting tactors, thereby reducing bulkiness. To assess the effectiveness of QuadStretcher in facilitating immersive bare-hand experiences, we conducted a comparative user evaluation (n = 20) with a baseline solution, Squeezer. The results confirmed that QuadStretcher outperformed Squeezer in terms of expressing force direction and heightening the sense of realism, particularly in 3-DoF VR interactions such as pulling a rubber band, hooking a fishing rod, and swinging a tennis racket. We further discuss the design insights gained from qualitative user interviews, presenting key takeaways for future forearm-haptic systems aimed at advancing AR/VR bare-hand experiences.", "AI": {"tldr": "QuadStretcher\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u62c9\u4f38\u663e\u793a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u62c9\u4f38\u5355\u5143\u5728\u7528\u6237\u524d\u81c2\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a5\u5730\u57fa\u5ea7\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u88f8\u624b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728AR/VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u624b\u90e8\u88f8\u9732\uff0c\u5411\u7528\u6237\u624b\u90e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u524d\u81c2\u63d0\u4f9b\u95f4\u63a5\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86QuadStretcher\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u62c9\u4f38\u5355\u5143\u73af\u7ed5\u524d\u81c2\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u62b5\u6d88\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u5668\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u524d\u81c2\u63a5\u5730\u57fa\u5ea7\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bbe\u5907\u4f53\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08n=20\uff09\u786e\u8ba4QuadStretcher\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848Squeezer\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57283\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6VR\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "QuadStretcher\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u524d\u81c2\u89e6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdbAR/VR\u88f8\u624b\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/DJ-Fear/walrus_steering", "summary": "Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

A total of 130 participants (younger: 56; older: 74) completed a music-selection task under AI-use and AI-nonuse conditions across two contexts: previously experienced (road trip) and not previously experienced (space travel). In the AI-nonuse condition, participants generated candidate options from memory; in the AI-use condition, GPT-4o presented options tailored to individual preferences. To assess cognitive function, we also administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition. Results revealed that in the AI-nonuse condition, older adults with lower cognitive function reported higher choice difficulty and lower choice satisfaction. Under the AI-use condition, choice satisfaction did not change significantly, but perceived choice difficulty decreased significantly in both age groups. Moreover, AI use attenuated the associations observed among older adults between lower cognitive function and both greater difficulty and lower satisfaction.

Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u98de\u673a\u673a\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u968f\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u4e60\u77ed\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u5458\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u3001\u5148\u53d1\u5236\u4eba\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u524d\u4e2d\u6b62\u673a\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u89c2\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u98de\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India.

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration.

A small but growing line of research has explored tools and processes to better engage non-AI expert users in auditing generative AI systems. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of MIRAGE, a web-based tool exploring a \"contrast-first\" workflow that allows users to pick up to four different text-to-image (T2I) models, view their images side-by-side, and provide feedback on model performance on a single screen. In our user study with fifteen participants, we used four predefined models for consistency, with only a single model initially being shown. We found that most participants shifted from analyzing individual images to general model output patterns once the side-by-side step appeared with all four models; several participants coined persistent \"model personalities\" (e.g., cartoonish, saturated) that helped them form expectations about how each model would behave on future prompts. Bilingual participants also surfaced a language-fidelity gap, as English prompts produced more accurate images than Portuguese or Chinese, an issue often overlooked when dealing with a single model. These findings suggest that simple comparative interfaces can accelerate bias discovery and reshape how people think about generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86MIRAGE\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f18\u5148\"\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u504f\u89c1\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u6539\u53d8\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8ba9\u975eAI\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86MIRAGE\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f18\u5148\"\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u6700\u591a\u56db\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u67e5\u770b\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6392\u663e\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4ece\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u5411\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\"\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u53cc\u8bed\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u754c\u9762\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u504f\u89c1\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u5851\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter \u03c3. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

Halpern", "Rafael Pass"], "title": "Causality Without Causal Models", "comment": "In Proceedings TARK 2025, arXiv:2511.20540", "summary": "Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models.

It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.\n  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5373\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u91c7\u6837\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u6700\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u91cd\u7f6e\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u91cd\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($\u0394R_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($\u03ba= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale.

This paper coins the term \"responsible computational foresight\", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures.

Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u7b49\u6743\u91cd\uff09\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u572811\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u80fd\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6807\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u7b49\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001AUC\uff09\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u5b50\u7ec4\u5047\u9634\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8fdb\u5316\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u5927\u5c0f\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u6700\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u6070\u5f53\u65f6\u3002"}}

Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($\u0394t\\!=\\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$\u0394t$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $\u0394t$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($\u0394t = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability.

The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors.

However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u590d\u6742\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SpatialBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5f80\u5f80\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b15\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6SpatialBench\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u9ad8\u5c42\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\uff1a\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u800cMLLMs\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6d4b\u91cfMLLMs\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).\n  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs.

This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated.

However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions.

However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFANoise\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684InfoNCE\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u9759\u6001\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFANoise\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7840VLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFANoise\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FANoise\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5176\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings.

However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u4ea4\u9519\u91cd\u7f6e\uff08staggered resets\uff09\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u70b9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u7f6e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u540c\u6b65\u56de\u653e\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728GPU\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u5316\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u77ed\u56de\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u540c\u6b65\u91cd\u7f6e\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u626d\u66f2\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u7834\u574f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u9519\u91cd\u7f6e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8ba9\u73af\u5883\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6279\u6b21\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u540c\u6b65\u56de\u653e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u6734\u7d20\u540c\u6b65\u56de\u653e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u9519\u91cd\u7f6e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains.

To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "TDP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6bcf\u6b65\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u534711-24.8\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bcf\u6b65\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u9891\u7e41\u5207\u6362\u89c4\u5212\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5236\u5b9a\u77ed\u671f\u8be6\u7ec6\u3001\u957f\u671f\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u5668(TDP)\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u9010\u6e10\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u540e\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u66f4\u65b0\u524d\u4e00\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u504f\u5dee\u8fc7\u5927\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6bcf\u6b65\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTDP\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u534711-24.8\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6216\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TDP\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses \"minimum group confidence\" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u8861\u5fae\u8c03\uff08BFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8868\u9762\u6307\u4ee4\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5185\u5316\u788e\u7247\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "BFT\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u5728token\u7ea7\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u635f\u5931\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\"\u6700\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\"\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eBFT\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\uff1a\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230SFT\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8aGeneAgent\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u57fa\u56e0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "BFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate.

At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\\sim$20$\\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\\sim$2-3$\\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton.

Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5143\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u732e\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8111\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5927\u8111\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Lorentz\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u7ae0\u6587\u672c\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8111\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u8111\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8111\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u8111\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5143\u5206\u6790\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u66f2\u8111-\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5143\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the \"user-item decoupling\" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65e9\u671f\u6392\u5e8f(GESR)\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(MoA)\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u786c\u5339\u914d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u903b\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u95e8\u63a7(MLPG)\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u6392\u5e8f\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u4eb2\u548c\u5ea6\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGESR\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542bMoA\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u786c\u5339\u914d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u663e\u5f0f\u4ea4\u53c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u7528\u6237\u8868\u793a\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u548cMLPG\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u4e3b\u6b21\u903b\u8f91\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ESR\u9636\u6bb5\u90e8\u7f72\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "GESR\u8303\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u6392\u5e8f\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ESR\u9636\u6bb5\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions.

Empirical study of LLM-based verified program synthesis in Lean4 (code, specs, and proofs)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets.

However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes.

While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity.

This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways.

In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MDLMs\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790MDLMs\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0MDLMs\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u9644\u52a0\u63a9\u7801\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dMDLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process.

Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807DPC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd110\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5982Infidelity\u4f9d\u8d56\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316(PC)\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9a\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316(DPC)\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "DPC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd110\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e24\u4e2a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e03\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8986\u76d64744\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "DPC\u4e0ePC\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6574\u4f53\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC.

Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics.

This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features.

While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability.

Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model.

While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs.

We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems.

Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u6838\uff08MD-GAK\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53PMD-GAK\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u80bd\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u901a\u900f\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5316\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6b8b\u57fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73af\u80bd\u662f\u9776\u5411\u7ec6\u80de\u5185\u4f4d\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u901a\u900f\u6027\u4ecd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e14\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MD-GAK\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6b8b\u57fa-\u6b8b\u57fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u95f4\u9699\u60e9\u7f5a\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u89d2\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u7684PMD-GAK\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0cPMD-GAK\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u989d\u5916\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MD-GAK\u548cPMD-GAK\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u73af\u80bd\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u901a\u900f\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}
