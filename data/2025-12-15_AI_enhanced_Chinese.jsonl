The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL.

While some frame AI as a replacement for human intelligence, and others warn of cognitive decline, this position paper argues for a third perspective grounded in practical observation: AI as a cognitive amplifier that magnifies existing human capabilities rather than substituting for them. Drawing on research in human-computer interaction, cognitive augmentation theory, and educational technology, alongside field observations from corporate training across writing, software development, and data analysis domains, I present a framework positioning AI tools as intelligence amplification systems where output quality depends fundamentally on user expertise and judgment. Through analysis of empirical studies on expert-novice differences and systematic observations from professional training contexts, I demonstrate that domain knowledge, quality judgment, and iterative refinement capabilities create substantial performance gaps between users. I propose a three-level model of AI engagement -- from passive acceptance through iterative collaboration to cognitive direction -- and argue that the transition between levels requires not technical training but development of domain expertise and metacognitive skills. This position has critical implications for workforce development and AI system design. Rather than focusing solely on AI literacy or technical prompt engineering, I advocate for integrated approaches that strengthen domain expertise, evaluative judgment, and reflective practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u653e\u5927\u5668\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u7ea7AI\u53c2\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u81eaGPT-3\u65f6\u4ee3\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u7684AI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u624b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5c06AI\u89c6\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u6216\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u8b66\u544a\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff1aAI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5199\u4f5c\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u57f9\u8bad\u5b9e\u5730\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06AI\u5de5\u5177\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6-\u65b0\u624b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u57f9\u8bad\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u9020\u6210\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u7ea7AI\u53c2\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u63a5\u53d7\u5230\u8fed\u4ee3\u534f\u4f5c\u518d\u5230\u8ba4\u77e5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c42\u7ea7\u95f4\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u6280\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8AI\u7d20\u517b\u6216\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002AI\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u653e\u5927\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "FutureWeaver\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u590d\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u534f\u4f5c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6216\u5728\u660e\u786e\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8de8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFutureWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5c01\u88c5\u4e3a\u53ef\u8c03\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u4ece\u8fc7\u5f80\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u62bd\u8c61\u51fa\u91cd\u590d\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFutureWeaver\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FutureWeaver\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

First, these systems frequently operate as 'black boxes', leaving their decision-making processes opaque. Second, audit logs often lack reliability, as the entity operating the system may alter them. In this work, we introduce the concept of Immutable Explainability, an architecture designed to address both challenges simultaneously. Our approach combines an interpretable inference engine - implemented through fuzzy logic to produce a transparent trace of each decision - with a cryptographic anchoring mechanism that records this trace on a blockchain, ensuring that it is tamper-evident and independently verifiable. To validate the approach, we implemented a heuristic pipeline integrating lexical and prosodic analysis within an explicit Mamdani-type multimodal fusion engine. Each inference generates an auditable record that is subsequently anchored on a public blockchain (Sepolia Testnet). We evaluated the system using the Spanish MEACorpus 2023, employing both the original corpus transcriptions and those generated by Whisper. The results show that our fuzzy-fusion approach outperforms baseline methods (linear and unimodal fusion). Beyond these quantitative outcomes, our primary objective is to establish a foundation for affective AI systems that offer transparent explanations, trustworthy audit trails, and greater user control over personal data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\"\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u951a\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u60c5\u611fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e5\u5fd7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u60c5\u611fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5982\u540c\"\u9ed1\u7bb1\"\uff1b2) \u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e5\u5fd7\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u65b9\u53ef\u80fd\u7be1\u6539\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u751f\u6210\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff09\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u951a\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5c06\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bb0\u5f55\u5728\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e0a\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u97f5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Mamdani\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5f15\u64ce\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u951a\u5b9a\u5728Sepolia\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f51\u516c\u94fe\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u897f\u73ed\u7259MEACorpus 2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u539f\u59cb\u8f6c\u5f55\u548cWhisper\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5f55\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u7cca\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u60c5\u611fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u65e2\u900f\u660e\u53c8\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u60c5\u611fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Medicinal chemists must navigate a vast protein space to identify target proteins that meet three criteria: physical and functional interactions, therapeutic impact, and docking potential. Prior approaches have provided fragmented support for each criterion, limiting the generation of promising hypotheses for wet-lab experiments. We present HAPPIER, an AI-powered tool that supports hypothesis generation with integrated multi-criteria support for target identification. HAPPIER enables medicinal chemists to 1) efficiently explore and verify proteins in a single integrated graph component showing multi-criteria satisfaction and 2) validate AI suggestions with domain knowledge. These capabilities facilitate iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, essential for hypothesis generation.

The hardware overhead of commonly adopted VR-based mHealth solutions further hinders their widespread clinical application. Therefore, we developed Breast-Rehab, a novel, low-cost mHealth system to provide patients with out-of-hospital upper limb rehabilitation management. Breast-Rehab integrates a bespoke human action recognition algorithm with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. By fusing visual and 3D skeletal data, our model accurately segments exercise videos recorded in uncontrolled home environments, outperforming standard models. These segmented clips, combined with a domain-specific knowledge base, guide a multi-modal large language model to generate clinically relevant assessment reports. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead and mitigates model hallucinations. We implemented the system as a WeChat Mini Program and a nurse-facing dashboard. A preliminary clinical study validated the system's feasibility and user acceptance, with patients achieving an average exercise frequency of 0.59 sessions/day over a two-week period. This work thus presents a complete, validated pipeline for AI-driven, at-home rehabilitation monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Breast-Rehab\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c3D\u9aa8\u9abc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0eRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u672f\u540e\u60a3\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e0a\u80a2\u5eb7\u590d\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u5e78\u5b58\u8005\u672f\u540e\u4e0a\u80a2\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb6\u5ead\u5eb7\u590d\u953b\u70bc\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edfVR\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u65b9\u6848\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Breast-Rehab\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c3D\u9aa8\u9abc\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u953b\u70bc\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6307\u5bfc\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u53d7\u63a7\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u953b\u70bc\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u521d\u6b65\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u4e24\u5468\u5185\u5e73\u5747\u953b\u70bc\u9891\u7387\u8fbe0.59\u6b21/\u5929\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u5bb6\u5ead\u5eb7\u590d\u76d1\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u672f\u540e\u60a3\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u5eb7\u590d\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study proposes a data-driven metric and a continuous reward function to optimize personalized heparin therapy in surgical sepsis patients. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining \"good\" or \"bad\" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days. TECM demonstrated consistent outcomes across models, highlighting robustness.

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

We term this structural reliance Human-Instead-of-AI (HISOAI). HISOAI systems represent an ethical failure and an unsustainable economic dependency, where human workers function as hidden operational fallbacks rather than strategic collaborators. To rectify this, we propose the AI-First, Human-Empowered (AFHE) paradigm. AFHE mandates a technological design where the AI component must achieve a minimum, quantifiable level of functional independence prior to deployment. This standard is formalized through the AI Autonomy Coefficient (alpha), a metric that determines the proportion of tasks that the AI successfully processes without mandatory human substitution. We introduce the AFHE Deployment Algorithm, an algorithmic gate that requires the system to meet a specified alpha threshold across both offline and shadow testing. By enforcing this structural separation, the AFHE framework redefines the human's role to focus exclusively on high-value tasks, including ethical oversight, boundary pushing, and strategic model tuning, thereby ensuring true system transparency and operational independence. This work advocates for a critical shift toward metric-driven, structurally sound AI architecture, moving the industry beyond deceptive human dependency toward verifiable autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faHISOAI\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63ed\u793aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faAFHE\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u6570\u03b1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u4fddAI\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4e\u529f\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u89d2\u8272\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u6ee5\u7528\"\u4eba\u5728\u56de\u8def\"\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63a9\u76d6\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\"\u4eba\u66ff\u4ee3AI\"\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u6210\u4e3a\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\u5907\u800c\u975e\u6218\u7565\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42AI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5fc5\u987b\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6700\u4f4e\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7AI\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u6570\u03b1\u6765\u8861\u91cfAI\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u66ff\u4ee3\u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165AFHE\u90e8\u7f72\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u95e8\u63a7\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5f71\u5b50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u03b1\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "AFHE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u7c7b\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f26\u7406\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u62d3\u5c55\u548c\u6218\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5021\u5bfc\u5411\u5ea6\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5168\u7684AI\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u952e\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u884c\u4e1a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002"}}

We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent.

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

While intent communication has been widely studied, existing approaches lack the spatial specificity and semantic depth necessary to convey robot touch actions. We present Mirror Skin, a cephalopod-inspired concept that utilizes high-resolution, mirror-like visual feedback on robotic skin. By mapping in-situ visual representations of a human's body parts onto the corresponding robot's touch region, Mirror Skin communicates who shall initiate touch, where it will occur, and when it is imminent. To inform the design of Mirror Skin, we conducted a structured design exploration with experts in virtual reality (VR), iteratively refining six key dimensions. A subsequent controlled user study demonstrated that Mirror Skin significantly enhances accuracy and reduces response times for interpreting touch intent.

While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that \"sculpts\" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization.

Our approach combines memory-efficient infrastructure for 64K-token contexts using hybrid parallelism and kernel-level optimizations with a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that mitigates distribution mismatch through verified, aligned synthetic data. Furthermore, we detail a robust Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) pipeline that stabilizes training via difficulty-aware data filtering and mixed-policy trajectory reuse.

Large language models have been adopted and evaluated as a corrective methodology, given their high power for predictions. Nevertheless, their predictions are not always correct, which can lead to lower usability.

However, extending classical methods such as policy iteration to this setting remains difficult; the output process is non-Markovian, making policy-improvement steps interdependent across stages. We introduce a new family of monotonically improving policy-iteration algorithms that alternate between single-stage output-based policy improvements and policy evaluations according to a prescribed periodic pattern. We show that this family admits optimal patterns that maximize a natural computational-efficiency index, and we identify the simplest pattern with minimal period. Building on this structure, we further develop a model-free variant that estimates values from data and learns memoryless policies directly. Across several POMDPs examples, our method achieves significant computational speedups over policy-gradient baselines and recent specialized algorithms in both model-based and model-free settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08POMDPs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u6267\u884c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u8f93\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3POMDPs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ecd\u7136\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7684\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u6b65\u9aa4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u6267\u884c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u8f93\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u6309\u7167\u9884\u5b9a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u5bb6\u65cf\u5305\u542b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPOMDPs\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3POMDPs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u6267\u884c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212ILP\uff09\u4e0eAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PatternBoost\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548cPPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5728No-Three-In-Line\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ILP\u572819\u00d719\u7f51\u683c\u5185\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u800cAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "No-Three-In-Line\u662f\u7ec4\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfILP\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6269\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u4e0eAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08ILP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b2\uff09\u9996\u6b21\u5e94\u7528PatternBoost\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3\uff09\u9996\u6b21\u5e94\u7528PPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5728n\u00d7n\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "ILP\u572819\u00d719\u7f51\u683c\u5185\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff1bPatternBoost\u572814\u00d714\u7f51\u683c\u5185\u5339\u914d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u635f\u5931\u51cf\u5c1196%\uff1bPPO\u572810\u00d710\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u7f8e\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u572811\u00d711\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u56e0\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800cAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In many applications using graphs, it is desirable to allow users to edit graphs to ensure data accuracy or provides updates. Commonly in graph visualization, users can interact directly with the visual elements by clicking and typing updates to specific items through traditional interaction methods in the graphical user interface. However, it can become tedious to make many updates due to the need to individually select and change numerous items in a graph. Our research investigates natural language input as an alternative method for editing network graphs. We present a user study comparing GUI graph editing with two natural language alternatives to contribute novel empirical data of the trade-offs of the different interaction methods. The findings show natural language methods to be significantly more effective than traditional GUI interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfGUI\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u6709\u6548", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u8282\u70b9-\u94fe\u63a5\u56fe\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u8981\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u8c31\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6216\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u4f20\u7edfGUI\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u8981\u9010\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u5927\u91cf\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7e41\u7410\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83GUI\u56fe\u8c31\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u6cd5\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfGUI\u4ea4\u4e92\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u6709\u6548", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u7387"}}

However, current ECG models are trained under the assumption of clean and non-ambiguous annotations, which limits both the development and the meaningful evaluation of models under real-world conditions. Although Partial Label Learning (PLL) frameworks are designed to learn from ambiguous labels, their effectiveness in medical time-series domains, ECG in particular, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity. Through extensive analysis, we identify key limitations of current PLL approaches in clinical settings and outline future directions for developing robust and clinically aligned ambiguity-aware learning frameworks for ECG diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PLL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e869\u79cdPLL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u75be\u75c5\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u6b67\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709ECG\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u5047\u8bbe\u6807\u7b7e\u662f\u5e72\u51c0\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PLL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fECG\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5c069\u79cdPLL\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u5230\u591a\u6807\u7b7eECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\uff09\u3002\u5728PTB-XL\u548cChapman\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cPLL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f53\u524dPLL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u6a21\u7cca\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u7684ECG\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups.

This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u8bed\u97f3\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08S2S-RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5d29\u6e83\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u662f\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u662f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u540e\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u97f3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u5e38\u5e38\u611f\u89c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u5757\u5316S2S-RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6469\u64e6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5d29\u6e83\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u521a\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6469\u64e6\u70b9\u5982\u4f55\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6469\u64e6\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u7f3a\u9677\u6216\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u63a7\u5236\u800c\u975e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u540e\u679c\u3002\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u521a\u6027\u4e09\u79cd\u5177\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8bed\u97f3AI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u5b64\u7acb\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8f6c\u5411\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7f16\u6392\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5355\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of inference time reasoning methods applied across both open-source and closed-source VLMs on different benchmarks. Our results reveal that while closed-source models consistently benefit from structured reasoning and iterative Self-Refinement, open-source VLMs show inconsistent behavior: external verification provides the most reliable gains, whereas iterative refinement often degrades performance. We further find that the effectiveness of TTS is dataset-dependent, yielding clear improvements on multi-step reasoning tasks but offering only limited gains on perception-focused benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that TTS is not a universal solution and must be tailored to both model capabilities and task characteristics, motivating future work on adaptive TTS strategies and multimodal reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55(TTS)\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001VLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u6e90VLM\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002TTS\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6539\u8fdb\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55(TTS)\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90VLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90VLM\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002TTS\u6548\u679c\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u660e\u663e\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "TTS\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TTS\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u673a\u3002"}}

We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse.

However, AI benchmarks are increasingly complex, requiring dynamic, AI-focused workflows. Rapid evolution in model architectures, scale, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target. Large language models often memorize static benchmarks, causing a gap between benchmark results and real-world performance.\n  Beyond traditional static benchmarks, continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks are needed to align scientific assessment with deployment risks. This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.\n  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use. Benchmarks should support application-relevant comparisons, enabling informed, context-sensitive decisions. Dynamic, inclusive benchmarking will ensure evaluation keeps pace with AI evolution and supports responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment.

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFairOBD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u6709\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFairOBD\uff08\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u7ebf\u6210\u672c\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u6216\u6709\u9650\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\uff1b2\uff09FairOBD\u5728\u8003\u8651T\u2192\u221e\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6e10\u8fdb\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cFairOBD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u603b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "FairOBD\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u547d\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.

Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5728\u571f\u58e4\u901a\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6db2\u6ef4\u51b2\u51fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528EfficientNetV2\u4e3a\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6570\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff1b3. \u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u805a\u96c6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c07\u5206\u79bb\uff1b4. \u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5e94\u7528UMAP\u751f\u62102D\u6295\u5f71\uff1b5. \u4f7f\u7528\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u901a\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6db2\u6ef4\u51b2\u51fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u6216\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, city-level data often exists in heterogeneous formats, collected independently by local agencies with diverse objectives and standards. Despite their numerous, wide-ranging, and uniformly consumable nature, national-level datasets exhibit significant heterogeneity and multi-modality. This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities. The results show that our proposed framework demonstrates strong predictive performance while requiring minimal reconfiguration when transferred to new localities or domains.

The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems. In this new paradigm, progress on the benchmark is progress on the science, thus reframing \"benchmarking\" as a vehicle for scientific advancement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8fdb\u5c55\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\"\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5NanoGPT\u901f\u5ea6\u8dd1\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u6392\u884c\u699c\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5806\u6808\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5df2\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5c55\u793a\u57fa\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fdb\u5c55\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5NanoGPT\u901f\u5ea6\u8dd1\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5207\u7247\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53cd\u4f5c\u5f0a\u68c0\u67e5\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u589e\u91cf\uff1a\u6700\u4f73\u635f\u5931\u503c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8be5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u8bb0\u5f55\u5feb3\u79d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u6027\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u65b0\u9896\u7b97\u6cd5\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u662f\u624b\u6bb5\u800c\u975e\u76ee\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u5c31\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\"\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\"\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u8f7d\u4f53\u3002"}}

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.\n  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction.

We make an attempt by studying rank constraints, which, as a generalization to conditional independence constraints, exploits the ranks of covariance submatrices in linear Gaussian models. We show that although selection can significantly complicate the joint distribution, interestingly, the ranks in the biased covariance matrices still preserve meaningful information about both causal structures and selection mechanisms. We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of such rank constraints. Using this tool, we demonstrate that the one-factor model, a classical latent variable model, can be identified under selection bias.

Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression. Preliminary experiments on LLaMA-3 8B demonstrate 55-67% reduction in active KV cache size while maintaining generation quality and passing needle-in-haystack retrieval tests.

We present the \\textbf{first application of SAEs to the 3D domain}, analyzing the features used by a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction VAE applied to 53k 3D models from the Objaverse dataset. We observe that the network encodes discrete rather than continuous features, leading to our key finding: \\textbf{such models approximate a discrete state space, driven by phase-like transitions from feature activations}. Through this state transition framework, we address three otherwise unintuitive behaviors -- the inclination of the reconstruction model towards positional encoding representations, the sigmoidal behavior of reconstruction loss from feature ablation, and the bimodality in the distribution of phase transition points. This final observation suggests the model \\textbf{redistributes the interference caused by superposition to prioritize the saliency of different features}.

Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178Golay\u7801\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5QGEC\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Golay\u7801\u6bd4toric\u7801\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6613\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u5bf9\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u5143\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50Golay\u7801\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5QGEC\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5Golay\u7801\u3002\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8f83\u5c0f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u7ed9\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002Golay\u7801\uff08\u9700\u898123\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\uff0c\u7801\u8ddd\u4e3a7\uff09\u6bd4toric\u7801\uff08\u9700\u898150\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\uff0c\u7801\u8ddd\u4e3a5\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7fGolay\u7801\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aGolay\u7801\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

All exhibit substantial degradation on unseen domains, unfamiliar modalities, or cross domain task shifts despite strong performance within their training distributions.These failures manifest as modality misalignment, output format instability, and catastrophic knowledge degradation under domain transfer.Our findings reveal a persistent gap between the aspiration of generalist intelligence and the actual capabilities of current foundation models.MultiNet v1.0 provides a standardized evaluation substrate for diagnosing these gaps and guiding the development of future generalist agents.Code, data, and leaderboards are publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "MultiNet v1.0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1MultiNet v1.0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5e38\u8bc6\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30GPT-5\u3001Pi0\u548cMagma\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u3001\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u6362\u65f6\u90fd\u51fa\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5931\u8d25\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u671f\u671b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002MultiNet v1.0\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored. Standard forecasting models fail to make this distinction, often either overreacting to noise or missing persistent shifts. We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data.

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86EDPs\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eEDPs\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u9002\u5408\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7fa4\u4e0d\u53d8\u6f5c\u5728\u566a\u58f0MDP\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u7b49\u53d8\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1b3. \u9632\u6b62\u4ef7\u503c\u53d1\u6563\uff1b4. \u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u6709\u9650\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684EDPs\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks. Notably, NSPO is data-efficient and only requires 40% of public human-annotated safety data from PKU-SafeRLHF to achieve promising safety performance, without a large amount of mixed general tasks data in existing alignment methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "NSPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0e\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08NSPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0e\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u59cb\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "NSPO\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7b49\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4ec5\u9700PKU-SafeRLHF\u4e2d40%\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6df7\u5408\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "NSPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

While Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift (GBMS) has proven effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters in Euclidean space, it struggles with datasets exhibiting hierarchical or tree-like structures. In this work, we introduce HypeGBMS, a novel extension of GBMS to hyperbolic space. Our method replaces Euclidean computations with hyperbolic distances and employs M\u00f6bius-weighted means to ensure that all updates remain consistent with the geometry of the space. HypeGBMS effectively captures latent hierarchies while retaining the density-seeking behavior of GBMS. We provide theoretical insights into convergence and computational complexity, along with empirical results that demonstrate improved clustering quality in hierarchical datasets. This work bridges classical mean-shift clustering and hyperbolic representation learning, offering a principled approach to density-based clustering in curved spaces.

However, achieving such cross-dataset, fully inductive inference is difficult in graph-structured data where feature spaces vary widely in both dimensionality and semantics. Any transformation in the feature space can easily violate the inductive applicability to unseen datasets, strictly limiting the design space of a graph model. In this work, we introduce the view space, a novel representational axis in which arbitrary graphs can be naturally encoded in a unified manner. We then propose Graph View Transformation (GVT), a node- and feature-permutation-equivariant mapping in the view space.

However, interpretability requires both sensible linguistic partitions and small rule-base sizes, which are not guaranteed by many existing fuzzy rule-mining algorithms. Evolutionary approaches can produce high-quality models but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while neural-based methods like ANFIS have problems retaining linguistic interpretations. In this work, we propose an adaptation of classical tree-based splitting algorithms from crisp rules to fuzzy trees, combining the computational efficiency of greedy algoritms with the interpretability advantages of fuzzy logic. This approach achieves interpretable linguistic partitions and substantially improves running time compared to evolutionary-based approaches while maintaining competitive predictive performance. Our experiments on tabular classification benchmarks proof that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers with significantly lower computational cost and produces more interpretable rule bases with constrained complexity.

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65e0\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u5404\u81ea\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u8c03\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b9e\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u6458\u8981\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u800c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff08\u9002\u5e94\u5f53\u524d\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u8fc7\u53bb\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u538b\u7f29\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u538b\u7f29\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.\n  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.\n  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1). Experiments spanning over 56,000 training rounds show that SpectralKrum is competitive against directional and subspace-aware attacks (adaptive-steer, buffer-drift), but offers limited advantage under label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpectralKrum\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u6784\uff08\u975eIID\uff09\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u89c2\u5bdf\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Krum\u3001Bulyan\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f1a\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "SpectralKrum\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u8c31\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\uff1a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u826f\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f1a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u805a\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u9644\u8fd1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4f20\u5165\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528Krum\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u90a3\u4e9b\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b8b\u5dee\u80fd\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5019\u9009\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528Dirichlet\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u975eIID\u5206\u533a\uff08alpha=0.1\uff09\u5bf98\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8986\u76d67\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u548c\u8d85\u8fc756,000\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002SpectralKrum\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u548c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\uff08adaptive-steer\u3001buffer-drift\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u548c\u6700\u5c0f-\u6700\u5927\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6076\u610f\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "SpectralKrum\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u79c1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d. Gaussian inputs, we lean on the fact that the softmax operator converges in the infinite-prompt limit to a linear operator acting on the underlying input-token measure. Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0bsoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6790\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662ftransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7ed9\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6765\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528softmax\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8ei.i.d.\u9ad8\u65af\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u754c\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u957f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7ee7\u627f\u5176\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6d53\u5ea6\u754c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u63d0\u793a\u8db3\u591f\u957f\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u4e0bsoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002"}}

We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \\approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC).
